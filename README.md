# Research Question(s)
- How do different climate change scenarios, namely RCP 2.6 - SSP1 (Sustainability: low challenges to mitigation and adaptation), RCP 4.5 - SSP2 (Middle of the road: medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), RCP 7.0 - SSP3 (Regional rivalry: high challenges to mitigation and adaptation), and RCP 8.5 - SSP5 (Fossil-fueled development: high challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation), impact illegal immigration in the Mexico-US Border from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, considering socioeconomic factors such as food security, GDP per capita, unemployment rate, internal displacement, poverty, education, and corruption?

- Additionally, how do these scenarios affect migrants who are sent back to Mexico and what appropriate policies can be developed to address their needs within Mexico? Lastly, how can these projections inform policy decisions to address the implications of climate-induced migration flows?
